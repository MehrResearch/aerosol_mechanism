Authors: Zehua Li and S. Hessam M. Mehr

This reposistory contains the following:

* `Analysis.ipynb`: Data analysis notebook
* `src/models/model_lda.py`: A simple model based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) for decomposition of MS chromatograms into contributions of different components over time.
* analysis model, and experiment code in MicroPython (targetting the [AeroBoard](https://github.com/MehrResearch/aeroboard) via the [CtrlAer](https://github.com/MehrResearch/ctrlaer) library) for experiments descibed in the manuscript and SI.
